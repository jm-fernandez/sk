 * This file contains the implementation of a more precise timer than that
 * provided by DOS. Routines are provided to increase the PIT clock rate to
 * around 1165 interrupts per second, for a granularity of close to 858
 * microseconds between clock pulses, rather than the 55 milliseconds between
 * standard PC clock pulses (18.2 times/second).
 *
 * Note that the timer_start() routine must be called before the timer_read()
 * routines will work, and that the timer_stop() routine MUST be called
 * before the program terminates, or the machine will be toasted. For this
 * reason, timer_init() installs the timer_stop() routine to be called at
 * program exit.
